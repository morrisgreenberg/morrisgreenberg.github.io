# Welcome to my website!

I am Morris Greenberg, a second year master's student in Statistical Science at Duke University. My research interests center around Bayesian methods for large data, specifically applied to health care. I currently do research with Li Ma of the Statistical Science Department at Duke and a team at Duke Cancer Institute in analyzing the microbiome.
